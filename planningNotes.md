#### Story
Quackenbush has run out of toilet paper. He receives a flyer from his local grocery store – they just got a shipment of Quadrupal-ply Tushie Soft – his fav. But hurry down because supplies are limited because The Karens are out in force, determined to snap up every last roll of Tushie Soft.

Join Quackenbush in his adventure of obtaining the unobtainable – a roll of Tushie Soft. Avoid free-floating COVID-19 spores, and the Sample Lady (Plague on a Stick!). Follow the maze that is our Mrs. M’s Everyday Market aisles. Check out the latest in PPE – like Mason’s Disinfection Spray and Col. X’s Fabulous Bar Soap. But avoid The Karen’s because a collision with one will have them pepper spraying you and yelling for the manager. Grab a roll of Tushie Soft and exit the store through the self-checkout and you are home free.

#### Objective
Maze game with obstacles. Player is set in a location and trying to avoid COVID 19 and navigate to a item. Then to the exit.

Item decreases as time goes on. You need to navigate the maze and get to the item before it is gone.


P1 starts out at the entrance to the store. Objective – obtain a roll of toilet paper (in upper, left-hand area of playing field) and get through check-out line and out the exit. Toilet paer counts down as lives are lost. When all the rolls are gone, play is done.

COVID-19 spores – they spawn and float around, unconstrained throughout the playing field.

Sample Ladies – they are constrained to one spot in the game (end of certain aisles). The continuously thrust out samples (Plague on a Stick).

The Karens – they spawn at the coffee shop in the upper middle of the playing field (Caffeine R Me). They create an obstacle that you need to avoid. If you come into contact with a Karen, they will try to pepper spray you and yell for the manager. If they successfully spray you, you are penalized a 5 second halt to your movement.


There will be no more than 6 at a time on the playing field. A spore can be “eradicated” by a spray of Mason’s Disinfection Spray. If a spore successfully “infects” you, P1 is dead.
Sample Ladies – they are constrained to one spot in the game (end of certain aisles). The continuously thrust out samples (Plague on a Stick). If the Stick touches you – you are penalized with a 3 second halt to your movement.
